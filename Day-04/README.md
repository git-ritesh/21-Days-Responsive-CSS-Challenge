# Day-04 | Catch-up Day

Today is a catch-up day so no official Lessons.
### Extra-curricular

If you are eager to dive keep learning though, there has been some talk about viewport units in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/9w5M4uAK).

Up next is a video where I take a look at them. A word of warning though, I do look at using them for font-size, and while cool, there are some accessibility issues with doing so, so I wouldn't suggest it unless it's just for a personal project of yours.

This is totally optional, and while they can be useful, they will not be something I'll be diving into in this course.

If you do like them and want to practice with them, there is no reason you can't incorporate them into future challenges though!
